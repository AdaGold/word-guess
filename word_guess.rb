# each object of Game class represents a new game of Word Guess
class Game
# when a new Game object is initialized: an empty array (guess_history) is created to store all the guesses
# made throughout a given game, a random_word is generated from the WORD_LIST constant, and two arrays are populated:
#     (1) the unsolved_array starts as an array of each character of the random_word;
#     (2) the solved_array starts as an array of "_" characters; there is one element for each character
#         in the random_word
# the idea is that as correct letter guesses are made, those letters are removed from the unsolved_array
# (replaced with "_") and moved to the solved_array where they replace the "_" in the corresponding index position(s)
# image_index starts a 0; this will increment with each wrong answer to determine which image from  IMAGES_CHASE gets displayed
# num_unique letters is set equal to the number of unique characters in the random word
# max_guesses is equal to the number of unique characters + 3. This will keep the difficulty of the game somewhat constant.  For exmaple,
# the word "sassy" only has 3 unique characters, so the user will only have 6 letter guesses.
# num_guess is set equal to max_guesses to start. This will decrement with each guess.
# attr_reader makes it so we can access the value of these variables for a given Game object from the Board class
