############List of verbs ##############################################
#guessing a letter
#checking if letter is in word - appropriate reponce if it is in word or not (modify word displayed if it is, decrease number of guesses if it isn't)
#removing the dashes if the letter is in the word
#Keep track of how many guesses are left

#validating user input
#verifying user input is one letter
#Display letters that have already been guessed (create an array to add guessed letter to, and check that)
#Changing ASCII-art based on number of wrong guesses

#A match method to guess if dash array now equals letter array
#lose method - when guessing have been decreased to zero (method that counts guesses?)

########## classes #########################################################
# word is a class
# each letter is a class? Use letter instance within the instance of the word class
#ASCII-art in its own class? Or just within the word class


###########################
#Things to do
#for difficulty level have three different arrays of different length words, case statement to pick from one of them depending on what difficulty user wants
#allow the user to enter the whole word
